# Custom vendor health HAL

This repo is an implementation of the [android.hardware.health][health-ref] HAL,
based on the [official guide][guide] and existing device-specific
implementations.

It was written for Sony devices from 2016 onward, but it should work on other
devices with a few small modifications as well.
Most notably, the sysfs paths might be different and the persist partition might
be mounted at `/persist` instead of `/mnt/vendor/persist`.

This HAL has a `HealthTestingMock` for debugging purposes. It is only available
in userdebug/eng builds. The prop `persist.vendor.health.fake_storage=1` will
trigger fake stats.

## Implementing

To start using this HAL, you need to do the following:

Add the HAL to the [vendor device manifest][vintf-manifest].  
For SODP, that file is in [device-sony-common/vintf/manifest.xml][sodp-manifest].
```
    <hal format="hidl">
        <name>android.hardware.health</name>
        <transport>hwbinder</transport>
        <version>2.0</version>
        <interface>
            <name>IHealth</name>
            <instance>default</instance>
        </interface>
    </hal>
```

Add android.hardware.health@2.0-service-.sony to `PRODUCT_PACKAGES` and remove
the obsolete backup healthd instance that is shipped by default.  
For SODP, that is done in `common-treble.mk`:
```
# Health (in addition to own board libhealth)
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += \
    android.hardware.health@2.0-service.sony
# Remove deprecated backup healthd
DEVICE_FRAMEWORK_MANIFEST_FILE += \
    system/libhidl/vintfdata/manifest_healthd_exclude.xml
```

Add the binary to sepolicy `file_contexts`:
```
/(system/vendor|vendor)/bin/hw/android\.hardware\.health@2\.0-service\.sony  u:object_r:hal_health_default_exec:s0
```

And allow vendor_init to create the /mnt/vendor/persist/battery/ folder.  
```
# vendor_init.te:
allow vendor_init persist_battery_file:dir create_dir_perms;
```

# Internals for developers

Many features of this HAL were taken from the Pixel family of devices.
[Marlin][marlin](Pixel 1), [Wahoo][wahoo](Pixel 2) and
[Crosshatch][crosshatch](Pixel 3) all have more or less the same implementation.
We don't need to do quite as much logging as they do, so Pixelstats-related
functions have been stripped out.

Another difference are the battery cycles: The pixel battery driver is able to
report cycles for 8 individual "bins" for what are presumably groups/blocks of
battery cells instead of one single cycle count. If your device supports those
"bins" as well, take a look at the pixel `CycleCountBackupRestore`
implementation.

## Terminology

- SoC = State of Charge, e.g. from 0-100%
  (n.b. "SoC" is normally understood to mean "System-on-chip")
- FG = Fuel Gauge, similar to SoC
- BMS = Battery Management System

**USB terms**

- SDP = Standard downstream port(2.5-500mA)
- CDP = Charging downstream port(up to 1500mA)
- DCP = Dedicated charging port(up to 1500mA)

**Type-C terms:**

- UFP = "Upstream-facing port", i.e. the port that flows towards the computer
- DFP = "Downstream-facing port", i.e. the port that flows from the device
  towards another device, perhaps USB audio output

**Internals:**
- CC/CV = Constant current / constant voltage (CC/CV)
  For lithium batteries: When nearly depleted, use constant current for
  charging. When approaching max voltage, use contant voltage.
- OCV = Open circuit voltage
- CC = Coulomb counter
- PMIC = [Power Management Integrated Circuit][pmic]
- SPMI = [System Power Management Interface][spmi]
- FCC = Full charge capacity
- ESR = [Equivalent series resistance][esr]
